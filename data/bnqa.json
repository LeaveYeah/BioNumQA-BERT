METHODS: We conducted a phase 2, single-cohort, 25-center, global study of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months. RESULTS: For this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 81%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of event-free survival and overall survival were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60 to 82) and 90% (95% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 35 to 64) and 76% (95% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months.

A better protection of healthy tissues by improved beam ballistics, with particle therapy, is expected to decrease significantly late effects without decreasing local control and survival. This article reviews the scientific literature to advocate indications of protontherapy and carbon ion therapy for childhood central nervous system cancer, and estimate the expected therapeutic benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed on paediatric brain tumour treatments using Medline (from 1966 to March of 2014). To be included, clinical trials had to meet the following criteria: age of patients 18 years or younger, treated with radiation, and report of survival. Studies were also selected according to the evidence level. A secondary search of cited references found other studies about cognitive functions, quality of life, the comparison of photon and proton dosimetry showing potential dose escalation and/or sparing of organs at risk with protontherapy; and studies on dosimetric and technical issues related to protontherapy. RESULTS: A total of 7051 primary references published were retrieved, among which 40 clinical studies and 60 papers about quality of life, dose distribution and dosimetry were analysed, as well as the ongoing clinical trials. These papers have been summarized and reported in a specific document made available to the participants of a final 1-day workshop. Tumours of the meningeal envelop and bony cranial structures were excluded from the analysis. Protontherapy allows outstanding ballistics to target the tumour area, while substantially decreasing radiation dose to the normal tissues. There are many indications of protontherapy for paediatric brain tumours in curative intent, either for localized treatment of ependymomas, germ-cell tumours, craniopharyngiomas, low-grade gliomas; or panventricular irradiation of pure non-secreting germinoma; or craniospinal irradiation of medulloblastomas and metastatic pure germinomas.

Gram negative bacteria are the commonest causes of neonatal Sepsis. The resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly high. The major reason for emerging resistance against antibiotics is that doctors often do not take blood cultures before starting antibiotics. We have carried out this study to find out various bacteria causing neonatal sepsis and their susceptibility to antibiotics for better management of neonatal sepsis. METHODS: A total of 130 neonates with sepsis who were found to be blood culture positive were taken in this study. Culture/sensitivity was done, isolated organisms identified and their sensitivity/resistance was noted against different antibiotics. Data were arranged in terms of frequencies and percentage. RESULTS: Out of 130 culture proven cases of neonatal sepsis, gram negative bacteria were found in 71 (54.6%) cases and gram positive bacteria in 59 (45.4%) cases. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria found in 35 (26.9%) cases followed by Escherichia coli in 30 (23.1%) cases.

Average annual changes (AAC) between the most recent and penultimate survey were calculated for under-five mortality rates and for 22 variables in the domains of clinical, outreach, and family- and community-based services. For all 27 countries and a subset of 19 African countries, we conducted principal component analysis to reduce the variables into a few components in each domain and applied linear regression to assess the correlation between changes in the principal components and changes in under-five mortality rates after controlling for multiple potential confounding factors. RESULTS: AAC in under 5-mortality varied from 6.6% in Nepal to -0.9% in Kenya, with six of the 19 African countries all experiencing less than a 1% decline in mortality. The strongest correlation with reductions in U5MR was observed for access to clinical services (all countries: p=0.02, r\u00b2 = 0.58; 19 African countries p<0.001, r\u00b2 = 0.67). For outreach activities, AAC U5MR was significantly correlated with antenatal care and family planning services, while AAC in immunization services showed no association.

There are no studies regarding the coexistence of compressive cervical myelopathy with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis and the effect of decompressive surgery. METHODS: Nagoya Spine Group database included 1560 cases with cervical myelopathy treated with cervical laminectomy or laminoplasty from 2001 to 2005.

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis.

Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.

Random-forest analysis, principal component analysis, and integrated hierarchical clustering methods demonstrated that metabolomics profiles separated the two cohorts with 100% accuracy. Severe AAH was associated with enhanced triglyceride lipolysis, impaired mitochondrial fatty acid beta oxidation, and upregulated omega oxidation. Low levels of multiple lysolipids and related metabolites suggested decreased plasma membrane remodeling in severe AAH. While most measured bile acids were increased in severe AAH, low deoxycholate and glycodeoxycholate levels indicated intestinal dysbiosis. Several changes in substrate utilization for energy homeostasis were identified in severe AAH, including increased glucose consumption by the pentose phosphate pathway, altered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, and enhanced peptide catabolism.

METHOD: We conducted a structured review of epidemiologic studies in community settings (that is, in the general population or in workplaces). Evidence was restricted to the peer-reviewed, published, English-language literature up to the end of June 2005. We further restricted evidence to studies that used recent classification systems; then, if evidence was insufficient, we reviewed studies that used standardized psychiatric screening scales. To distinguish this article from recent reviews of health and work quality, we focused on new areas of investigation and new evidence for established areas of investigation: underemployment, organizational justice, job control and demand, effort-reward imbalance, and atypical (nonpermanent) employment. RESULTS: Depression and simple phobia were found to be the most prevalent disorders in the working population. The limited data on rates of participation suggested higher participation among people with depression, simple phobia, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. Depression and anxiety were more consistently associated with \"presenteeism\" (that is, lost productivity while at work) than with absenteeism, whether this was measured by cutback days or by direct questionnaires.

RESULTS: Here we report that transposon-free regions (TFRs) are prominent genomic features of amphibian and fish lineages, and that many have been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution, although most transposon-derived sequences have entered these lineages after their divergence. The zebrafish genome contains 470 TFRs over 10 kb and a further 3,951 TFRs over 5 kb, which is comparable to the number identified in mammals. Two thirds of zebrafish TFRs over 10 kb are orthologous to TFRs in at least one mammal, and many have orthologous TFRs in all three mammalian genomes as well as in the genome of Xenopus tropicalis. This indicates that the mechanism responsible for the maintenance of TFRs has been active at these loci for over 450 million years.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving. METHODS: We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined. RESULTS: In accordance with prior studies, beta E was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71).

Correction of acidosis may therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters.

Of 42 possible points, 7 points are directly related to measurement of language compared with only 2 points related to neglect. METHODS: We examined the placebo arm of the NINDS t-PA stroke trial to test the hypothesis that the total volume of cerebral infarction in patients with right hemisphere strokes would be greater than the volume of cerebral infarction in patients with left hemisphere strokes who have similar NIHSS scores. The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume. RESULTS: The volume for right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS (P<0. 001). For each 5-point category of the NIHSS score<20, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes.

However, the debate on whether or not DNA methylation is a reliable indicator of high nucleosome occupancy has not been settled.

In this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome.

Additionally, outside of CpG islands, the density of CpGs within nucleosomes was shown to be important for the nucleosomal location of DNA methylation with low CpG frequencies favoring linker methylation and high CpG frequencies favoring core particle methylation.

METHODS: Patients who underwent open VHR and were followed for at least 1 mo were included. Using two data sets-a retrospective multicenter database (Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative) and a single-center prospective database (Prospective)-each patient was assigned a predicted risk with each of the following models: Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS), Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wound Class, and Hernia Wound Risk Assessment Tool (HW-RAT). Patients in the Prospective database were also assigned a predicted risk from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]) were compared to assess the predictive accuracy of the models for SSO and SSI. Pearson's chi-square was used to determine which models were able to risk-stratify patients into groups with significantly differing rates of actual SSO and SSI.

In recent years new or atypical antipsychotics have been introduced. These are less likely to produce movement disorders and raise serum prolactin. Researchers have suggested that molindone should be classified as an atypical antipsychotic. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of molindone compared with placebo, typical and other atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and related psychoses. SEARCH STRATEGY: For the original search we searched the following databases: Biological Abstracts (1980-1999), The Cochrane Library CENTRAL (Issue 1, 1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 1999), CINAHL (1982-1999), EMBASE (1980-1999), MEDLINE (1966-1999), LILACS (1982-1999), PSYNDEX (1977-1999), and PsycLIT (1974-1999). We also searched pharmaceutical databases on the Dialog Corporation Datastar and Dialog and the references of all identified studies for further trials. Finally, we contacted the manufacturer of molindone and the authors of any relevant trials. For the update of this review, we searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (August 2005). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials that compared molindone to other treatments for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

We excluded data if loss to follow up was greater than 50%. MAIN RESULTS: We included fourteen studies. Duration ranged from very short (10 days) studies of the intramuscular preparation, to trials lasting over three months. For measures of global assessment, available data do not justify any conclusions on the comparative efficacy of molindone and placebo.

Unlike cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma disseminates preferentially to the liver through the hematogenous system. To date, the mechanism underlying this metastatic homing is largely unknown. This study investigated the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-triggered signaling pathways to identify the role of HGF and its downstream effectors in inducing the migration of uveal melanoma cells. METHODS: Migration of uveal melanoma cells was measured by in vitro wound healing and transwell migration assays. The expression and translocation of c-Met were detected using indirect immunofluorescence. The activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways was analyzed using specific antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-Akt. The impact of HGF treatment on the expression of cell adhesion molecules was measured using Western blotting. RESULTS: HGF was found to enhance cell migration, and that HGF-induced migration depends on PI3K/Akt pathway. The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced by the HGF/c-Met axis is involved in the downregulation of cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and beta-catenin, contributing to the attenuation of cell-cell adhesion and promoting the enhanced motility and migration of uveal melanoma cells.

Vitamin B12 and folic acid, levels of which are decreased in vitiligo, are important cofactors in the metabolism of Hcy. Consequently, a nutritional deficiency in either of these two vitamins will result in an increase in homocysteine in the circulation, a finding that we expect to find in vitiligo. OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of Hcy in the blood of patients with vitiligo as a first step in revealing if it has any relationship with the pathogenesis of vitiligo and consequently if this will have an impact on the treatment of vitiligo.

Limited research has implicated attentional biases among chronic headache patients, but no studies have been conducted among episodic migraineurs, who comprise the overwhelming majority of the migraine population. METHODS: This was a case-control, experimental study. Three hundred and eight participants (mean age=19.2 years [standard deviation=3.3]; 69.5% female; 36.4% minority), consisting of 84 episodic migraineurs, diagnosed in accordance with International Classification of Headache Disorders (2(nd) edition) criteria using a structured diagnostic interview, and 224 non-migraine controls completed a computerized dot probe task to assess attentional bias toward headache-related pictorial stimuli. The task consisted of 192 trials and utilized 2 emotional-neutral stimulus pairing conditions (headache-neutral and happy-neutral).

METHODS: Venous blood was obtained from 186 stroke patients within 24 h of hospital admission and 3-5 days thereafter in order to characterize an inflammatory and hemorheological profile (including erythrocyte aggregation). Neurological state was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin scale (mRs).

Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points. Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0.001 for NIHSS and p=0.001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles).", "qas": [{"question": "Is there an association between serum interleukin-6 concentrations and outcomes of stroke patients?", "id": "31ac1fae-ac9c-4ddc-a911-3c09e88f619d", "answers": [{"text": "Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points.

METHODS: Radiographs of fifty adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered.

The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada.

METHODS: In the period ranging from 1997 to 2003, 62 patients with EA underwent preoperative TBS. The procedure was carried out with flexible bronchoscope maintaining spontaneous breathing. When a wide carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy.

RESULTS: Before TBS, the Gross classification of the 62 patients was as follows: type A, 9 patients; type B, none; type C, 51 patients. At TBS, however, 3 of 9 type A patients had an unsuspected proximal fistula (type B). These 3 patients, plus the 2 with H-type fistula, were repaired through a cervical approach. In 4 patients, previously undetected malformations of the respiratory tree (2 aberrant right upper bronchus and 2 hypoplastic bronchi) were found at TBS. Carinal fistulas in 14 type C patients were occluded by Fogarty catheter to improve ventilation during repair. No complications were observed.

This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.

Using the random effects model, which assumes individual studies are estimating different treatment effects, the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine was determined by weighted mean differences (WMDs) and odds ratios (ORs). The findings were considered as statistically significant when the 95% CI of WMDs and ORs did not include 0 and 1, respectively.

Their effects in humans are not known. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg twice daily). If the second iodine-124 PET study indicated that a dose of iodine-131 of 2000 cGy or more could be delivered to the metastatic lesion or lesions, therapeutic radioiodine was administered while the patient was receiving selumetinib.

METHODS: We exposed human sarcoma cell lines to sorafenib, regorafenib, and pazopanib and assessed cell viability and expression of CSC markers (ALDH, CD24, CD44, and CD133). We evaluated survival and CSC phenotype in mice harboring sarcoma metastases after TKI therapy.

The purpose of this article is to present the data in the literature regarding the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of suicidality in subjects with autism spectrum disorders and to identify the factors that promote the transition to action. METHODS: This review was carried out using the data set collected in Medline PubMed, items with \"autism spectrum disorder\", \"pervasive developmental disorder\", \"Asperger's syndrome\", \"suicide\", \"suicide attempt\", and \"suicide behavior\". RESULTS: In all subjects from our research on PubMed, 21.3% of subjects with autism spectrum disorder reported suicidal ideation, have attempted suicide or died by suicide (115 out of 539 subjects) and 7.7% of subjects supported for suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide exhibited an autism spectrum disorder (62 out of 806 subjects), all ages combined. Suicidal ideation and morbid preoccupation are particularly common in adolescents and young adults. Suicide attempts are accompanied by a willingness for death and can lead to suicide. They are more common in high-functioning autism and Asperger subjects. The methods used are often violent and potentially lethal or fatal in two cases published. Suicide risk depends on many factors that highlight the vulnerability of these subjects, following autistic and developmental symptoms. Vulnerability complicating the diagnosis of comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders are major factors associated with suicidality. Vulnerability but also directly related to suicidality, since the origin of physical and sexual abuse and victimization by peers assigning them the role of \"scapegoat\" are both responsible for acting out.", "qas": [{"question": "Is there any association between suicide and autism in adolescents, yes or no?", "id": "4d6758b8-4d9f-4e42-81f5-bdfd39437ed8", "answers": [{"text": "Suicide attempts are accompanied by a willingness for death and can lead to suicide.

We evaluated the accuracy of a duplex Doppler ultrasonographic index for predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) by using endoscopy as the reference standard. METHODS: Fifty-six enrolled patients underwent duplex Doppler ultrasonography followed by screening endoscopy. Mean portal vein velocity (PVV), splenic index (SI), splenoportal index (SPI), hepatic and splenic arterial resistive, and pulsatility indices (hepatic artery resistive index [HARI], hepatic artery pulsatility index [HAPI], splenic artery resistive index [SARI], splenic artery pulsatility index [SAPI]) were recorded.

When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger.

RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed no major prognostic effect of tumor depth when grade and size were taken into account. The mean size of small tumors was the same whether superficial or deep but the mean size of large and deep-seated tumors were one third larger than that of large but superficial tumors.

It is unclear if anterior/apical prolapse (AA) repair provides additional benefit. We hypothesized that women with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) experience greater improvement in the OAB component of their symptoms after concomitant MUS and AA repair compared with MUS alone. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of women with bothersome MUI (defined by objective stress test and validated questionnaire) undergoing MUS alone (\"MUS-only\") or concomitant MUS and AA repair (\"MUS + AA\"). Our primary outcome was the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Severity (OAB-q SS) change score 6 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Of 151 women, 67 (44 %) underwent MUS-only and 84 (56 %) underwent MUS + AA. The MUS-only cohort was younger and had less severe baseline prolapse (p<0.05 for both). Postoperative complications (predominantly UTI) occurred in 35 (23 %) patients and were similar between cohorts. For all subjects mean OAB-q SS scores significantly improved postoperatively (p<0.05). Our primary outcome, OAB-q SS change score, showed no significant differences between cohorts (30\u00b126 MUS-only vs 25\u00b125 MUS + AA, p=0.20), indicating similar improvements in OAB symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed no difference in OAB-q SS change score between cohorts; however, OAB-q SS change scores were lower for women with a postoperative complication (\u03b2=-19, 95 % CI -31 to -6; p<0.01).", "qas": [{"question": "Does concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence?", "id": "2aaf7ec8-3b9f-40ba-a89f-aa7ecbcb168c", "answers": [{"text": "Our primary outcome, OAB-q SS change score, showed no significant differences between cohorts (30\u00b126 MUS-only vs 25\u00b125 MUS + AA, p=0.20), indicating similar improvements in OAB symptoms.", "answer_start": 1098}, {"text": "Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed no difference in OAB-q SS change score between cohorts; however, OAB-q SS change scores were lower for women with a postoperative complication (\u03b2=-19, 95 % CI -31 to -6; p<0.01).", "answer_start": 1285}, {"text": "Our primary outcome, OAB-q SS change score, showed no significant differences between cohorts (30\u00b126 MUS-only vs 25\u00b125 MUS + AA, p=0.20), indicating similar improvements in OAB symptoms.

METHODS: Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups. Metallic port integrated anatomic breast expanders of 250 cc were implanted on the back of each animal and controlled expansion was performed. Group I underwent radiotherapy with full expanders while in Group II, expanders were partially deflated immediately prior to radiotherapy. Control group did not receive radiotherapy.The changes in blood flow at different volume adjustments were investigated in Group II by laser Doppler flowmetry. Variations in the histopathologic properties of the irradiated tissues including the skin, capsule and the pocket floor, were compared in the biopsy specimens taken from different locations in each group. RESULTS: A significant increase in skin blood flow was detected in Group II with partial expander deflation. Overall, histopathologic exam revealed aggravated findings of chronic radiodermatitis (epidermal atrophy, dermal inflammation and fibrosis, neovascularisation and vascular changes as well as increased capsule thickness) especially around the lower expander pole, in Group II.", "qas": [{"question": "Does partial expander deflation exacerbate the adverse effects of radiotherapy in two-stage breast reconstruction?", "id": "c6a32d3a-1d00-4b52-991b-0901d07f9154", "answers": [{"text": "A significant increase in skin blood flow was detected in Group II with partial expander deflation.", "answer_start": 871}, {"text": "Overall, histopathologic exam revealed aggravated findings of chronic radiodermatitis (epidermal atrophy, dermal inflammation and fibrosis, neovascularisation and vascular changes as well as increased capsule thickness) especially around the lower expander pole, in Group II.", "answer_start": 971}, {"text": "A significant increase in skin blood flow was detected in Group II with partial expander deflation.
